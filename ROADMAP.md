### âœ¨ Core Features

* **Automatic File Classification:** Scans the target directory and classifies files into default categories based on their extension (e.g., Images, Documents, Archives, Audio, Video, Executables).
* **Sensible Subfolder Organisation:** Creates a clean folder structure (e.g., `~/Downloads/Fylum/Images`) to house the sorted files.
* **Smart File Renaming:** Renames files to a consistent `YYYY-MM-DD_original-filename.ext` format for easy chronological sorting.
* **Creation of Index Manifest:** Generates a `_fylum_index.md` file in the root of the organised folder, mapping every original filename to its new name and location for easy reference.
* **Basic CLI:** Run Fylum from your terminal with a single command to start the organisation process.
